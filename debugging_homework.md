- watch the following video: [Intro to Debugging video](https://youtu.be/ErVZrVWZrko)


Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
  To stop the program from running in the middle of the code. You can then look
  around within the code at that point and see values of variables etc.
2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
  No it stops before that line executes
3. How do we debug the next line of code?
  You use the step over command in the debugger to go to the next line
4. What does the step into command do?
  This command takes you inside of the chosen element
5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
  Evaluate expression is used for a single line of code(you do not use semi colons).
   Evaluate code fragment is used for evaluating multiple lines of code or multiple
   methods.
